# siteMonitor UWP/WPF/Winforms

C# Site Monitor project designed to test URL's response time and display data on a graph.

+ WinForms uses Datavisualization.Charting to display data
+ UWP and WPF both use OxyPlot - Ensure this is installed should you want to try this out. (Available in NuGet Package Manager)
 

More features to come.
+ Posting to REST API
+ Scrolling back through limited data
+ Ability to choose refresh time
+ Set quantity of results
+ Better display of timestamps of results on UWP and WPF to allow for better tracing in server logs to diagnose slow moments.
+ Native C++ version.
 
Suggestions and submissions welcomed to improve. Also open to including ports if requested and valid.
